# Boston Bus Tracker

## Description and Roadmap

The goal of this project was to use the MBTA API and the Mapbox API to create a map that tracks buses in Boston live. In its current version, it tracks the bus that runs between Harvard and MIT, but I wasn't able to delete previous markers. I plan to continue working to solve this problem, and build it out further from there, adding better looking markers and points of interest and potentially other bus routes.
